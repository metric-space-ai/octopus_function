Octopus Server <-> Octopus Function asynchronous communication

Octopus Server calls Octopus Function service on endpoint "/function-name" with method POST with JSON payload defined for each function.

/function-name endpoint responds with an object

{
  "id": UUID,
  "status": string,
  "progress": integer,
  "estimated_response_at": DateTime,
  "response": string,
  "file_attachements": [
    {
      "content": string,
      "file_name": string,
      "media_type": string,
    },
    {
      "content": string,
      "file_name": string,
      "media_type": string,
    }
  ]
}

status can have 3 values: initial, processing, processed
progress can have values from 0 to 100

In case if AI function can return a response in less than 5 seconds it can return an immediate response i.e.

{
  "id": "e0a15d60-6bc8-48de-b1dc-12cb87e4da13",
  "status": "processed",
  "progress": 100,
  "estimated_response_at": "2023-08-01 19:50:47+00",
  "response": "some text response from the system",
  "file_attachements": []
}

In case if AI function can not return a response in less than 5 seconds, it can return a partial response i.e.

{
  "id": "e0a15d60-6bc8-48de-b1dc-12cb87e4da13",
  "status": "initial",
  "progress": 0,
  "estimated_response_at": "2023-08-01 19:50:47+00",
  "response": null,
  "file_attachements": []
}

If the octopus server will not receive a response with the status "processed" it will poll for a response from the AI function on endpoint "/function-name/:id"

In such a scenario endpoint

"/function-name/e0a15d60-6bc8-48de-b1dc-12cb87e4da13"

Should return responses like

{
  "id": "e0a15d60-6bc8-48de-b1dc-12cb87e4da13",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 20,
  "estimated_response_at": "2023-08-01 19:51:00+00",
  "response": null,
  "file_attachements": []
}

In case if AI function is still processing the response.

Or response like

{
  "id": "e0a15d60-6bc8-48de-b1dc-12cb87e4da13",
  "status": "processed",
  "progress": 100,
  "estimated_response_at": "2023-08-01 19:52:00+00",
  "response": "some response from API",
  "file_attachements": [
    {
      "content": "asdfasdfjsadglksjadglkasdjg adfgafdgf",
      "file_name": "test.txt",
      "media_type": "text/plain",
    }
  ]
}

When the octopus server will receive a response with the status "processed" it will stop polling. Octopus server is taking into account estimated_response_at timestamp when polling.
